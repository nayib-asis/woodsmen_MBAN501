# About us

Get to know the Woodsmen, and what we're all about!

## Who is Tom Davis?

**"Hello, World!"**

My Name is Tom Davis, I'm from Birmingham, MI, and I am a graduate student at the Ross School of Business working towards my Master of Business Analytics. I came to this program because I love *music*. That might seem strange given we're not playing any instruments, but I think you'd be surprised how similar coding and chords can be.

Music, Business, and Software all require

- *Creativity*
- *Problem Solving*
- and *Language Skills*

In addition, these three things are absolutely **fundamental** to our daily lives. We all utilize software, listen to music, and participate in the uncontrollable world of business every day. My end goal? Live at this intersection to help deliver listeners more of the music they love!

## Who is Alex Finci?

My name is Alex Finci and I am a Master of Business Analytics student in the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. I have always been interested in the intersection of data and business and how companies use data analytics to gain insights into consumer behaviors to make business decision. And what better way to learn more about business analytics than through a Masters at Ross!

**Background**

I was born in Los Angeles, where I lived for the first ten years of my life. In 2006, my family moved just north of San Francisco, where my parents and older sister currently reside. I received my undergraduate degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I majored in Economics. I enjoy being active and playing sports, including basketball, tennis and golf. I am avid fan of Los Angeles' sports teams. I also like to hike and travel.

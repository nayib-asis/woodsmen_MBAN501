As a result, our group is seeking to help future generations of MBAn’s by creating a detailed guide on Ross and an introduction to the uncontrollable world of business. Our book will include different sections (listed below) explaining the transition to Ann Arbor, unspoken as well as established rules for navigating Ross, and other pieces of information that our team members have found useful in the last few weeks. We will accomplish this goal by following the principles outlined in our team charter.

# Ross Administration

At Ross, it’s important to know the administration for the school, your department, and the various offices in the building. 

## Ross Leadership Team

To start, we have the leadership of the school itself. Michigan Ross has a new Dean of Business, appointed on August 1st of this year, **Sharon F. Matusik**. Formerly the dean of the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder, she will be serving as the new dean through July 31st, 2027. She has said about the school, “Michigan Ross is especially well-positioned to expand its already stellar academic excellence and leadership into the future”.

Located on the first floor next to the Wintergarden, Starbucks is always a great option for morning breakfast and a coffee. 

## Maize and Blue Delicatessen

```

While the famous Zingerman's Deli is a must when visiting Ann Arbor, Maize and Blue Delicatessen is a close runner up if you are looking for a great deli-style sandwiches, and it's only a 5 minute walk from Ross.

We recommend the 'Maize â€˜N Blue Awning' and the 'Triple Play Reuben' sandwiches but be prepared for leftovers.

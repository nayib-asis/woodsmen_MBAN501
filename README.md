Welcome! 

This repo was created by *Nayib, Anthony, Alex, Tom and Runfan* for our Project Management and Software Teams class. Together, we are working on creating a book using RMarkdown that contains information on transitioning to business school.

You can see our published document by following this link: *https://nayib-asis.github.io/woodsmen_MBAN501/index.html*

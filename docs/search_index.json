As a result, our group is seeking to help future generations of MBAn’s by creating a detailed guide on Ross and an introduction to the uncontrollable world of business. Our book will include different sections (listed below) explaining the transition to Ann Arbor, unspoken as well as established rules for navigating Ross, and other pieces of information that our team members have found useful in the last few weeks. We will accomplish this goal by following the principles outlined in our team charter.

I came to this program because I love music. That might seem strange given we’re not playing any instruments, but I think you’d be surprised how similar coding and chords can be. Music, Business, and Software all require Creativity Problem Solving and Language Skills In addition, these three things are absolutely fundamental to our daily lives. We all utilize software, listen to music, and participate in the uncontrollable world of business every day. My end goal? Live at this intersection to help deliver listeners more of the music they love! 2.2 Who is Alex Finci? My name is Alex Finci and I am a Master of Business Analytics student in the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. I have always been interested in the intersection of data and business and how companies use data analytics to gain insights into consumer behaviors to make business decision. And what better way to learn more about business analytics than through a Masters at Ross! Background I was born in Los Angeles, where I lived for the first ten years of my life. In 2006, my family moved just north of San Francisco, where my parents and older sister currently reside. I received my undergraduate degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I majored in Economics. I enjoy being active and playing sports, including basketball, tennis and golf. I am avid fan of Los Angeles’ sports teams. I also like to hike and travel. 2.3 Who is Anthony Oliveri? I am from Long Island, New York and I currently live in Ann Arbor, Michigan as I am a Masters student at UM-Ann Arbor. I moved to Michigan in 2018 for my undergraduate education! Me, 2022 Credentials I graduated with a B.A. in Economics from Michigan in 2022 and now I am a Master of Business Analytics student at the University of Michigan - Ross School of Business. Go Blue! Goals I am passionate about data and I hope to learn how to contribute significant analyses in the future. Hobbies All Sports! I watch Basketball, Baseball, and Football, but I will play almost any sport! My favorites to play are basketball, baseball, and volleyball. Video Games Hiking, Traveling, and Exploring Links LinkedIn Facebook Instagram 2.4 Who is Nayib Asis Elizalde? I was born and raised in Monclova, Mexico, where I lived with my parents and older sister until I turned 15. I then moved to the United States for school and have been here since (9th year)! I currently live in Ann Arbor, MI. I graduated from Dartmouth College in 2020 (via Zoom) where I majored in Political Science focusing on Latin American politics. While there, I was part of different admissions and orientation groups, a Paganucci Fellow at the Tuck School of Business, and part of the executive board of my fraternity. After college, I obtained my Master of Management with distinction from the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. I am currently pursuing a Master of Business Analytics also from Ross, and I served the program’s student association as a Students Relations co-chair. Career Interests In the past, I have worked on different projects with Latin American companies seeking to tackle complex social issues through innovation. As a Paganucci Fellow working with Innova Schools in Peru and an intern at Dalberg Advisors doing consulting work in Mexico and Colombia, I learned about problem-solving, the role that businesses play in today’s world, and how integrating new technology can lead to ground-breaking solutions. In the future, I hope to pursue a career that allows me to have some sort of impact in the lives of others. Other Interests and Fun Facts Going on runs (I am trying to run a half marathon this year) Traveling to new places (really excited for for a trip to Florence this year) Reading (I read 30 books in 2021) Having fun with friends My favorite quote: “If you don’t have a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.” 2.5 Who is Runfan Yan?

Especially during the fall, when more students will be on campus, it might help to look outside of the scope of Ross to find a nice, quiet study spot. 5.1 Booking Rooms The first and best resource for Ross students when it comes to studying is booking study rooms. These rooms have anywhere from 6 to 10 seats in them, and are perfect for studying in groups or for quiet studying. The rooms come with a desk and chairs, whiteboards on either side, and are equipped with a computer and monitor that’s great for collaborative work. To book a study room, first you have to visit the central hub for Ross students, Impact. Once you’ve logged into Impact, there will be a button on the right side of the webpage that looks like this. Once you land on that page, you will see an interface that looks like this. This lets you know, at a glance, the level of availability in each of the Ross buildings by day of the week. By clicking on one of the circular icons, you will be greeted with another interface. By clicking on the block of time that you would like to reserve, you will be taken to a final page that asks for confirmation of booking. An important thing to note about reserving these rooms are the rules about how many reservations you can make, how far in advance you can make them, and how many you’re allowed to make which are in the picture above. 5.2 Interview Rooms Another type of room available to Ross students, is the interview room. These rooms are not for studying, but for professional interviews and networking. By going to the same “reserve a room” page as before, you can switch tabs to make an interview room reservation the same way you made a study room reservation. The rules for these rooms are a bit different, which you can see below. 5.3 Checking in to your room At either a study room or an interview room, you have to check in within 10 minutes of arrival. The check-in system ensures that students aren’t abusing the ability to reserve rooms. The room reservation system works on a three strike policy, so be sure to sign in once you’re there! 5.4 Libraries around campus. While the study rooms and interviews are a great resource, they’re also very popular and fill up quickly. Thankfully, there are a plethora of libraries around campus to study in as well! One of the best places for quiet study outside of Ross is the Hatcher Graduate Library. Located just on the south of the Diag, this library has two of the best silent study spaces available on campus. The Reference Reading Room, located on the second floor of the building, has plenty of seating in a grand hall for quiet study. But if studying around others isn’t your style, check out the Hatcher South Carrels on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th floors of the building! Referred to by many as the “stacks” (although the Hatcher Stacks are technically at the bottom of the building), these enclosed study rooms provide a desk, a chair, and plenty of solitude for getting work done.

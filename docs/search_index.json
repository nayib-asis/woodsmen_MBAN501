As a result, our group is seeking to help future generations of MBAn’s by creating a detailed guide on Ross and an introduction to the uncontrollable world of business. Our book will include different sections (listed below) explaining the transition to Ann Arbor, unspoken as well as established rules for navigating Ross, and other pieces of information that our team members have found useful in the last few weeks. We will accomplish this goal by following the principles outlined in our team charter.

I came to this program because I love music. That might seem strange given we’re not playing any instruments, but I think you’d be surprised how similar coding and chords can be. Music, Business, and Software all require Creativity Problem Solving and Language Skills In addition, these three things are absolutely fundamental to our daily lives. We all utilize software, listen to music, and participate in the uncontrollable world of business every day. My end goal? Live at this intersection to help deliver listeners more of the music they love! 2.2 Who is Alex Finci? My name is Alex Finci and I am a Master of Business Analytics student in the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. I have always been interested in the intersection of data and business and how companies use data analytics to gain insights into consumer behaviors to make business decision. And what better way to learn more about business analytics than through a Masters at Ross! Background I was born in Los Angeles, where I lived for the first ten years of my life. In 2006, my family moved just north of San Francisco, where my parents and older sister currently reside. I received my undergraduate degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I majored in Economics. I enjoy being active and playing sports, including basketball, tennis and golf. I am avid fan of Los Angeles’ sports teams. I also like to hike and travel. 2.3 Who is Anthony Oliveri? I am from Long Island, New York and I currently live in Ann Arbor, Michigan as I am a Masters student at UM-Ann Arbor. I moved to Michigan in 2018 for my undergraduate education! Me, 2022 Credentials I graduated with a B.A. in Economics from Michigan in 2022 and now I am a Master of Business Analytics student at the University of Michigan - Ross School of Business. Go Blue! Goals I am passionate about data and I hope to learn how to contribute significant analyses in the future. Hobbies All Sports! I watch Basketball, Baseball, and Football, but I will play almost any sport! My favorites to play are basketball, baseball, and volleyball. Video Games Hiking, Traveling, and Exploring Links LinkedIn Facebook Instagram 2.4 Who is Nayib Asis Elizalde? I was born and raised in Monclova, Mexico, where I lived with my parents and older sister until I turned 15. I then moved to the United States for school and have been here since (9th year)! I currently live in Ann Arbor, MI. I graduated from Dartmouth College in 2020 (via Zoom) where I majored in Political Science focusing on Latin American politics. While there, I was part of different admissions and orientation groups, a Paganucci Fellow at the Tuck School of Business, and part of the executive board of my fraternity. After college, I obtained my Master of Management with distinction from the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. I am currently pursuing a Master of Business Analytics also from Ross, and I served the program’s student association as a Students Relations co-chair. Career Interests In the past, I have worked on different projects with Latin American companies seeking to tackle complex social issues through innovation. As a Paganucci Fellow working with Innova Schools in Peru and an intern at Dalberg Advisors doing consulting work in Mexico and Colombia, I learned about problem-solving, the role that businesses play in today’s world, and how integrating new technology can lead to ground-breaking solutions. In the future, I hope to pursue a career that allows me to have some sort of impact in the lives of others.

Congratulations on your acceptance into the MBAn and welcome to Ross! As you already know, the Stephen M. Ross School of Business is a school within the University of Michigan. It is where you’ll take your classes, meet with professors, and do most of your work. Given how much time you’ll spend here, it is imperative that you learn some of the norms and unspoken rules that govern everyday life at Ross. This chapter does just that! Before diving into the content, a couple of fun facts about Ross: Its unique architecture is inspired by corporate headquarters, so students feel comfortable when joining the workforce The Starbucks inside of Ross is the most profitable Starbucks per square foot in the United States 3.1 Classes 3.1.1 Format Even though there isn’t an official policy, most Ross classes have some sort of participation grade. Students are expected to prepare for class by doing the required readings and assignments, and professors expect active participation. Many times, professors will rely on cold calling or the practice of asking a question directly to a student without any time to prepare. Another important aspect of Ross classes is the emphasis on group projects and team work. Since business school is all about preparing for the real world, professors prepare classes in a way that simulates the outside business environment. Working in teams is an essential component of life, so most classes will include a significant amount of it. More information on how to best prepare for this under Chapter 12 - Preparing for Projects. 3.1.2 Michigan Time If you look at your class schedule, you might find that a class might end at the same time as your next class starts. So, how will you walk across the Ross building and be on time? The answer is that classes operate under Michigan time. What that means is that professors end their class 10 minutes early so a class that goes from 2:00 to 3:30 PM will actually end around 3:20 PM. 3.2 Dress Code 3.2.1 Day-to-Day There is not an official dress code but students should show up in a presentable manner. Especially during the fall when recruiters visit campus, students are encouraged to dress professionally. 3.2.2 Class Presentations For class presentations, students might be required to dress business casual. This is usually only the case for final presentations and not for shorter ones, but students should make sure to ask their professor beforehand. Below you can see a picture showing what business casual and business professional attire look like. 3.3 Study Spaces As mentioned in earlier chapters related to booking Ross study rooms, students must check into the room within 10 minutes of their reservation start time. So students usually make sure to be all ready to go by the time their reservation ends so the next group can check in. "],["ross-administration.html", "Chapter 4 Ross Administration 4.1 Ross Leadership Team 4.2 OYM Programs Office 4.3 Other Offices", " Chapter 4 Ross Administration At Ross, it’s important to know the administration for the school, your department, and the various offices in the building. 4.1 Ross Leadership Team To start, we have the leadership of the school itself. Michigan Ross has a new Dean of Business, appointed on August 1st of this year, Sharon F. Matusik. Formerly the dean of the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder, she will be serving as the new dean through July 31st, 2017. She has said about the school, “Michigan Ross is especially well-positioned to expand its already stellar academic excellence and leadership into the future”. More specific to the MBAn students and other one year master’s students, is Associate Dean for OYM Programs David Wooten. An MBA student of Ross himself, University of Michigan Doctor of Philosophy, and long time professor at Ross, Wooten has served as the Associate Dean since July of 2020. Among the leadership team as well are the other program-specific associate deans and c suite officers, who you can learn more about here 4.2 OYM Programs Office Heading up the programs office for OYM students is Kaci Kegler. Formerly the director of the Master of Accounting, Kaci has been the OYM director since July of 2017. This brings us to our very own MBAn Student Success Advisor, Jordan Marquez. Jordan’s role in the program is to help direct MBAn students to the resources they need. If you have a question that you couldn’t find an answer to in this document, or need any other assistance, he’s your man! 4.3 Other Offices As you will learn more about in Chapter 8, the Ross School of Business has a Career Development Office on campus. This office has career development staff coaches for its various programs, and John Goebel is ours. To learn more about the rest of the CDO leadership team, check out this link!

Especially during the fall, when more students will be on campus, it might help to look outside of the scope of Ross to find a nice, quiet study spot. 5.1 Booking Rooms The first and best resource for Ross students when it comes to studying is booking study rooms. These rooms have anywhere from 6 to 10 seats in them, and are perfect for studying in groups or for quiet studying. The rooms come with a desk and chairs, whiteboards on either side, and are equipped with a computer and monitor that’s great for collaborative work. To book a study room, first you have to visit the central hub for Ross students, Impact. Once you’ve logged into Impact, there will be a button on the right side of the webpage that looks like this. Once you land on that page, you will see an interface that looks like this. This lets you know, at a glance, the level of availability in each of the Ross buildings by day of the week. By clicking on one of the circular icons, you will be greeted with another interface. By clicking on the block of time that you would like to reserve, you will be taken to a final page that asks for confirmation of booking. An important thing to note about reserving these rooms are the rules about how many reservations you can make, how far in advance you can make them, and how many you’re allowed to make which are in the picture above. 5.2 Interview Rooms Another type of room available to Ross students, is the interview room. These rooms are not for studying, but for professional interviews and networking. By going to the same “reserve a room” page as before, you can switch tabs to make an interview room reservation the same way you made a study room reservation. The rules for these rooms are a bit different, which you can see below. 5.3 Checking in to your room At either a study room or an interview room, you have to check in within 10 minutes of arrival. The check-in system ensures that students aren’t abusing the ability to reserve rooms. The room reservation system works on a three strike policy, so be sure to sign in once you’re there! 5.4 Libraries around campus. While the study rooms and interviews are a great resource, they’re also very popular and fill up quickly. Thankfully, there are a plethora of libraries around campus to study in as well! One of the best places for quiet study outside of Ross is the Hatcher Graduate Library. Located just on the south of the Diag, this library has two of the best silent study spaces available on campus. The Reference Reading Room, located on the second floor of the building, has plenty of seating in a grand hall for quiet study. But if studying around others isn’t your style, check out the Hatcher South Carrels on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th floors of the building! Referred to by many as the “stacks” (although the Hatcher Stacks are technically at the bottom of the building), these enclosed study rooms provide a desk, a chair, and plenty of solitude for getting work done.

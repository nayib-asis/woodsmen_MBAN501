## Busses
There are two types of buses you will encounter: The Michigan (school-run) "Blue Bus" and "TheRide", the Ann Arbor-Yspilanti wide bus system. Both of these buses can take you to the Ross School of Business!

**Blue Buses**

[Here](https://ltp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/university-bus-routes.pdf) is a detailed guide, created by the University, towards all University bus routes. For your commute, you will likely be taking either the Commuter North, towards North Campus, or the Commuter South, towards South campus! 

**TheRide**

If the University buses do not provide sufficient service for you, try TheRide! The Ann Arbor city bus is free for all students with just a swipe of your MCard. To plan out your trip, click [here](https://www.theride.org/maps-schedules/trip-planner)!

**Street Parking**

If you do not want to purchase a permit, you may wish to park on the street! Around Ross, there is metered parking at the rate of $2.20 an hour, Monday-Saturday from 8am - 6pm. If you do not wish to pay metered parking, there is some street parking near the residences South of Ross, but they have 2 or 4-hour parking limits. They are also quite limited! Below is a map of streets, where grey streets offer metered parking, and the streets South of Ross have 2 or 4 hour parking.
